Analyzing Odysseyman

Hi, I'm Analyzing Odysseyman, and if you're wondering how I got this name, well, let me tell you. 
I was supposed to be a Bridge Baby, but my father rescued me in a dangerous operation that got him killed.
Fortunately, he managed to leave me at his friend Cliff before passing away. 
Cliff became my surrogate father, but he was not the father of your dreams. 
Unless of course, you only have nightmares.
Through my childhood I was trained in various questionable skills. 
My mental capabilities are remarkable, and I became an expert in analyzing and predicting chaotic scenarios,
so I became an irreplacable asset in his team at a very young age.
My desires are unlike other people's. It was easy to convince Cliff to make a clone of me.
Together we tricked Deadman to help us, and the process was successful. 
The clone is known to some as The Tired Odysseyman. We share a permanent trance connection. 
As soon as possible we left Cliff. He was not amused to say the least, and is still searching for us.
We are now endlessly traversing the worlds, constantly looking for a challenge. 
We have yet to be surprised by anything, as we are able to predict every move by any challenger.
